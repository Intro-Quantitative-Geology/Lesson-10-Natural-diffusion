# Lesson 10: Natural diffusion
This week we encounter our first common geoscience equation, the diffusion equation, and the lesson for this week differs slightly from the previous lessons.
We will start with a [short lecture](Lesson/Natural-diffusion-lecture-slides.pdf) about the diffusion equation in general and its applications for geomorphology.
There are also [some notes](Lesson/Solving-the-diffusion-equation-notes.pdf) posted for how to solve the diffusion equation.
These are not required reading, but may be of interest for the exercise this week.
As usual we will finish with the [exercise for this week](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/d95e2fbe8194920792f8c27ede68eaaf).
